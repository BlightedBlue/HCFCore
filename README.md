# HCRiots's Fixed Cores
## By funkemunky
You guys can use this if you want. Since HCRiots is no longer a thing, here you go. I made these awhile ago. It's a guranteed 20 TPS at 200 players I guess.

**Update** *(7/26/18)*: I was informed by the owner of VeilHCF that this was a fork of a leaked version of their core (and that would explain the exact spigot dependancy). I was asked to work on this by the owner of HCRiots, Inspect. However, the owner of Veil stated he doesn't care so have fun!
